### What is a PR?
Quote from Github:
```bash
Pull request lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a Github repo. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss modifications and even push follow-up commits if necessary.
```
Pull request are commonly used by teams and organizations collaborating using the Shared Repository Model, where everyone shares a single repo and topic branches are used to develop features and isolate changes. Many open source projects on Github use pull requests to manage changes from contributors as they are useful in providing a way to nofity project maintainers about changes one has made and in initiating code review and general discussion about a set of changes before being merged into the main branch.
