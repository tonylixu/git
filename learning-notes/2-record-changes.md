### File states
Each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked.
* Tracked: Files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged
* Untracked: Everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area
