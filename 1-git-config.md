### git config
Git comes with a tool called `git config` that lets your get and set configuration variables that controls alla spects of how Git looks and operates.
1. `/etc/gitconfig` file: Contains values applied to every user on the system and all their repositories. If you pass the option `--system` to `git config`, it reads and writes from this file specifically. (Because this is a system configuration file, you would need administrative or superuser privilege to make changes to it.)

2. `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config` file: Values specific personally to you, the user. You can make Git read and write to this file specifically by passing the `--global` option.

3. `config` file in the Git directory (that is, `.git/config`) of whatever repository youâ€™re currently using: Specific to that single repository.

Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in .git/config trump those in /etc/gitconfig.
